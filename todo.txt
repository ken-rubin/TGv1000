- New Project followed immediately by another New Project ends up with the type image two times in the toolstrip. We also don't clear the designer.
- Review code
- Navbar menu highlight color
- If description is ‘’ or null, the tooltip shouldn’t display the second line.
- Now that's there's no more huge + button in the TypeStrip, remove the offset to the left of the first Type.

- Search for project and open chosen one.
- Finish save project Business Object using promises -- probably promisify mysql to do it.
- Incorportate new scrollregion for project searching in project open (checkboxes for Only mine, Templates, I think). Is there a better name than 'Templates'?
- Finish Save Project now that Save As works well.
- Hungarian notation- m_setXxx -> m_functionSetXxx
- Consider adding paging to search results; like 100 at a time.
- Implement Change Comic image on context menu (not doing add new comic for now).
- Do New Type and Search for Type dialogs.
- Regarding duplicate project name within userId: I can see a scenario where a user goes to save as, changes the name to one already used (which does update the project), 
-    backs out (which doesn't reset the project's name) and then uses straight Save with this duplicate name. This must be prohibited.
- If project name is multiple words, that's how it is saved in tags and projects. Searcg will never work. Think about the _ thing again.
