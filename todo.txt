Questions (mostly J to K) or messages. Delete if answered or handled.
•	You know that last resouceId typo in Type.js? How did it ever work????
•	You'll have to do an npm install (and most likely run the db script) next time you pull.
•	Should I make description mandatory in project? How about image, sound, comic, type?
•	Should I add name back to image and sound resources for the tooltip?
•	If description is ‘’ or null, the tooltip shouldn’t display the second line.
