Prerequisites:

The project depends on the "node-dev" npm package to handle automatic server restarts and the "node-inspector" npm package for server debugging.  
Please install these resources globally for full integration.


Initialization:

Execute: "git clone https://github.com/ken-rubin/TGv1000.git", to get the code.
Then execute: "npm install", from the root project folder to install all required local npm package dependencies.


Execution:

Execute: "(sudo) npm start", to run the server.  Sudo is a Unix command to give administrative priviliges to the subsequent command.  This is necessary because the server listens on port 80 by default and this is a restricted port on most systems.  Windows users may require similar measures.
