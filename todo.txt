Either of us

- New Project followed immediately by another New Project ends up with the type image two times in the toolstrip. We also don't clear the designer.
- Review code
- Navbar menu highlight color
- Now that's there's no more huge + button in the TypeStrip, remove the offset to the left of the first Type.
- Get ScrollRegion2 tooltip to position better. There's something that works now, but it doesn't make sense. Look at it and adjust. Also, even though I see a tooltip when searching for a Project or a Project image,
-   I don't see a tooltip when I search for a Type image. Probably because it's not open over another dialog. I'm tired of tooltips. They're yours. Oh yeah: I don't display an empty description if it's "". And I
-   now don't display any tooltip for images. I decided images don't need names, since the user is looking at the image and can identify it that way.

- Not sure if my scrollregion-filling query in Search for/Open Project is totally correct. Especially check the effects of the checkboxes.
- Finish Save Project.
- Hungarian notation- m_setXxx -> m_functionSetXxx
- Consider adding paging to search results; like 100 at a time. See code below.
- Implement Change Comic image on context menu (not doing add new comic for now).
- Regarding duplicate project name within userId: I can see a scenario where a user goes into the save as dialog, changes the name to one already used (which does update the project in memory on the blur event), 
-    backs out (which doesn't reset the project's name back) and then uses straight Save with this duplicate name. This must be prohibited.
-    I think that the blur handlers in Save As need to update the project only if Save Project is called. Otherwise, they set member variables. That will handle this.
- Add logitems table in preparation for logging (like for forgotten password). Means adminzone needs some fleshing out.
- Replace existing scroll regions (comics, tools, types) with ScrollRegion2.
- Show at least the current project name someplace--the image, too, if possible
- Test New Type and Search for Type dialogs.


To discuss

- Every comic needs >=1 type (don't think that's a problem--every comic gets an type named 'app'). 
- If project name is multiple words, that's how it is saved in tags and projects. Search will never work. Think about replacing ' ' with '_' again.







Just saving this here for possible ScrollRegion paging:

2. Try using a Deferred Join

This is an interesting trick. Suppose you have pages of customers. Each page displays ten customers. The query will use LIMIT to get ten records, and OFFSET to skip all the previous page results. When you get to the 100th page, it's doing LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990. So the server has to go and read all those records, then discard them.

Also: AirBNB didn't have to fail during an AWS outage.

[code]
SELECT id, name, address, phone FROM customers ORDER BY name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990;
[/code]

MySQL is first scanning an index then retrieving rows in the table by primary key id. So it's doing double lookups and so forth. Turns out you can make this faster with a tricky thing called a deferred join.

The inside piece just uses the primary key. An explain plan shows us "using index" which we love!

[code]
SELECT id
FROM customers
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990;
[/code]

Now combine this using an INNER JOIN to get the ten rows and data you want:

[code]
SELECT id, name, address, phone
FROM customers
INNER JOIN (
SELECT id
FROM customers
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990)
AS my_results USING(id);
[/code]
