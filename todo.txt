Ken

- New Project followed immediately by another New Project ends up with the type image two times in the toolstrip. We also don't clear the designer.
- Review code
- Navbar menu highlight color
- If description is ‘’ or null, the tooltip shouldn’t display the second line.

Jerry

- Search for project and open chosen one
- Implement image search for projects, type - DOING THIS ONE NOW
- Finish save project using promises -- promisify mysql to do it.
- Incorportate new scrollregion for project searching in project open (checkboxes for Only mine, Templates, I think)
- Remove projects dialog and types dialog
- SaveAs button not solid. Why not? I think I fixed this.
- Hungarian notation- m_setXxx -> m_functionSetXxx
- When searching, for example, for images, add the "image" tag behind the scenes. But not userName.
- Consider adding paging to search results; like 100 at a time.
- Implement Change Comic image on context menu (not doing add new comic for now).
- Do New Type and Search for Type dialogs.
