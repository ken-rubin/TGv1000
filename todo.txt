- Finish Coder
- Integrate Coder
- CLick on the app Type's initialize method. All the Types are listed on the left-hand side of the code window. Make them like Control; i.e., [arrowhead] Types that opens on a click to reveal all the Types or no [arrowhead] and just display them all as Blockly blocks. 
     Will this be needed with Properties, Events?
- Resizing in the two vertical toolstrips seems to now lose aspect ratio. Toolstrip for sure.

- Consider adding paging to search results; like 100 at a time. See code sample below.
- Regarding duplicate project name within userId: I can see a scenario where a user goes into the save as dialog, changes the name to one already used (which does update the project in memory on the blur event), 
-    backs out (which doesn't reset the project's name back) and then uses straight Save with this duplicate name. This must be prohibited.
-    I think that the blur handlers in Save As need to update the project only if Save Project is called. Otherwise, they set member variables. That will handle this.
- I show the current project in the upper tab. I'm not sure I clear it if a project is closed, etc. So tighten this up. Shows the project name, if entered, for New Project. Check the Search for Project case.
- Places to show new BootstrapDialog.confirm to make sure they want to lose possible changes to current project. Show the dialog in these cases: go to AdminZone; click "TGv1000" to return to signin page; close window or browser (possible?)
- Call client.projectIsDirty() after ANYTHING the user does while in a project. Anything at all. Is there s better way to do this than putting the call in dozens of places???
- Need to finish delete Property, Method and Event. They don't call code to clean up Blockly. This is in Types.js.
- Write event loader in Code.js#self.addType.
- Items needed to finish PropertyGrid:
	- potentially (most likely) apply value changes on each keystroke and remove the buttons
	- add tool instance renaming capability
- Project / Quick Save may save twice--it flashes Save is complete twise and it doesn't go away the second time.



To discuss

- If someone buys a project/type/method, we want them to be able to modify/extend it. What's to keep their friend from copying it for free?We can keep them from retrieving a project that had a price, since it points back to a classOrProduct with a price.
- Use user sessions to make sure someone can't jump into the middle of the site without logging in.
- Uniquified picklist values are case sensitive. OK?






Just saving this here for possible ScrollRegion paging:

2. Try using a Deferred Join

This is an interesting trick. Suppose you have pages of customers. Each page displays ten customers. The query will use LIMIT to get ten records, and OFFSET to skip all the previous page results. When you get to the 100th page, it's doing LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990. So the server has to go and read all those records, then discard them.

Also: AirBNB didn't have to fail during an AWS outage.

[code]
SELECT id, name, address, phone FROM customers ORDER BY name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990;
[/code]

MySQL is first scanning an index then retrieving rows in the table by primary key id. So it's doing double lookups and so forth. Turns out you can make this faster with a tricky thing called a deferred join.

The inside piece just uses the primary key. An explain plan shows us "using index" which we love!

[code]
SELECT id
FROM customers
ORDER BY name25
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990;
[/code]

Now combine this using an INNER JOIN to get the ten rows and data you want:

[code]
SELECT id, name, address, phone
FROM customers
INNER JOIN (
SELECT id
FROM customers
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 990)
AS my_results USING(id);
[/code]
